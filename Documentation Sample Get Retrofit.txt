To use Get retrofit in recyclerview
1. First add dependencies for view model and retrofit
2. Next make file model, interface, intercept, and object
3. After making file package for network next is making repository for implement object file
4. Next make package for view model, in file view model implement MutableLiveData and repository
5. After making view model, next is make model view factory
6. Next make layout and adapter for recycler view, in adapter you must add emptyList and
    function then implement it to Kotlin also add adapter in view model and implement like this, 
                if (it.isSuccessful)
            {
                it.body().let { myAdapter.setData(it!!) }
		...
            }
    and in adapter is like this:
        recycler_retrofit.adapter = myAdapter

Note: make sure you parameter in interface, repository, Kotlin, and ViewModel must same in JSON
Note: to use recycler view JSON data must be array
